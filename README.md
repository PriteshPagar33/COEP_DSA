# Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository!📚

Welcome to the repository for **Data Structures and Algorithms** assignments! This repo contains the solutions for various DSA problems solved during the course at **College of Engineering Pune (COEP)**. These solutions are written in C.
 This collection contains various data structures and algorithm implementations primarily in C, covering content from the DSA-I and DSA-II courses and including all relevant assignments and lab work.

## 📖 Overview

This repository includes code implementations for a wide range of DSA problems and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming

The aim is to provide simple, clear, and efficient solutions to the fundamental problems that help in mastering DSA concepts. Each assignment is stored in its dedicated folder.

## Folder Structure 🗂️

Each folder contains three files:

- `header.h` 📄: Contains structure and function declarations.
- `logic.c` 🧩: The core logic and functionality of the DSA module.
- `main.c` 🎮: A testing ground to validate functionality and correctness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the COEP DSA assignments repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PriteshPagar33/COEP_DSA.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the directory of a specific data structure or assignment to compile the code:

```bash
cd COEP_DSA/Assignment_1/
```
## 3. Compile the code:
```bash
gcc main.c logic.c -o out
```

## 🛠️ Installation
The code in this repository doesn't require any specific installation. All you need is a C compiler.

### Prerequisites
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC for C/C++)
- IDE or Text Editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, IntelliJ IDEA)

## ▶️ Running DSA Solutions
After setting up, simply navigate to the desired problem folder and compile/run the code based on your setup.

```bash
gcc main.c logic.c -o out
./out
```
