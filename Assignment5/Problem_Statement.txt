Implement ADT Binary Search Tree(BST) using a linked list of nodes of structure having Month, left pointer, right pointer, and parent pointers pointing to left sub-trees, right sub-tree, and parent of the node.

Perform a series of insertions on keys - December, January, April, March, July, August, October, February, November, May, June.  Write following functions: 

initBST()         // to initialize the tree. 

insertNode()    // non-recursive function to add a new node to the BST. 

removeNode() // to remove a node from a tree. 

traverse()         // write any of the non-recursive traversal methods.

destroyTree()  // to delete all nodes of a tree.

Write a menu driven program to invoke all above functions.
