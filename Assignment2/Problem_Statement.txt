Define an ADT ASCII having a Doubly linked list of nodes of digits.

Write the following functions with suitable prototypes for ADT ASCII

init_ASCII() // to initialize the list

ASCII_of( )

/* This function should take a character as an argument and form a linked list of digits in its ASCII value. For example if ‘A’ is passed as a parameter, it should generate a list {6,5} */

traverse() // to display all the elements of the list.

Destroy() //  to destroy the list.

You are free to include more functions.

The skeleton of function main() is given below, use the same by replacing commented statements by actual function calls:

int main() {

ASCII L1;

//call init_ASCII()

// call ASCII_of( )

// call traverse()

//call Destroy()

//call traverse()

return 0;

}
